    image: ""
    content: |-
      Red Team Summit is an annual two-day conference in Q1/Q2, organized and hosted by internal Red Teams, for internal Red Teams to come together and share tips, tricks, and experiences. Red Team Summit is focused on how to be an effective attacker for your organization, and how to demonstrate the maximum value to your organization, rather than “Here’s how to hack my employer.”

      Offensive security operators present various TTPs and share lessons learned from accumulated successes and failures. The format is similar to Facebook's War Room event for Blue Teams.

      ### Audience
      This is an invitation only event. There are no ticket sales.

      Attendance is limited. Your organization must submit a talk in order to receive an invitation for attendance. Submission to CFP does not guarantee presentation acceptance, but does guarantee* attendance while capacity remains available.

      This event is targeted towards internal Red Teams -- the hackers responsible for simulating adversaries and testing the effective security controls of their organizations.
  
      ### A Community Event
      Red Team Summit is a community effort. It has been hosted by various companies who strive to keep it going in order to provide a forum for discussion among Red Teams.

    content: |-
      Red Team Summit is dedicated to providing an inclusive, harassment-free conference experience for everyone. We encourage all participants to make each other feel welcome in activities throughout the conference.

      We do not tolerate harassment of any kind. Harassment includes, but is not limited to, deliberate actions such as intimidation or targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.

      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including expulsion from the event and any future Red Team Summits.

      If you are being made to feel unwelcome, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer as soon as possible. If you are not sure who to contact, reach out to info@redteamsummit.com.

      By being part of Red Team Summit you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct.

    title: "Attendee Guidelines"
    image: ""
    content: |-
      1. All Attendees must agree to abide by the RTS Code of Conduct. Violators will be removed by the hosting organization, and may result in their organization being banned from RTS.
      1. This event is held under the Chatham House Rule. "When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed."
      1. In order to be invited to attend the Red Team Summit, your organization must have been invited and have submitted at least one bona fide submission to the CFP. Low quality ("throw-away") submissions to attempt to gain an invite will be discarded with prejudice.
      1. No recordings or photos without the permission of all individuals visible. No photos of slides without the permission of the speaker.
      1. We expect that all attendees will be engaged in internal Red Team activities, even if their team or role also performs other services. When distributing invitations within organizations, teams should use their best judgment on who will benefit from attending. Individuals engaged solely in detection and response ("Blue Team") activities are generally not a fit for this event.
