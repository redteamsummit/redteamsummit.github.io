The Red Team Summit hosted at Google is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
conference experience for everyone. We encourage all participants to make each
other feel welcome and included in activities throughout the conference. We do
not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Harassment
includes, but is not limited to, deliberate intimidation and targeting
individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or
afraid.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Google organizers
may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
expulsion from the event.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of Google staff immediately.

By participating in the Red Team Summit, whether as a speaker or participant,
you agree to abide by our code of conduct.
