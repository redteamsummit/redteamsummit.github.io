The Red Team Summit is an all-day conference in February for internal Red Teams
(by internal Red Teams) to share tips, tricks and experiences.  The Red Team
Summit is focused on how to be an effective attacker for your organization and
how to demonstrate the maximum value to your organization as opposed to "Here's
how to hack my employer."

Offensive security operators present various TTPs to share lessons
learned from accumulated successes and failures. The format is similar to
Facebook's War Room event for blue teamers.

Intended audience/participants are in-house pentest/red team staff who engage in
operations against their employer's environment(s) as external attackers. Does
your team write their own implants, run their own infra, and get shells?  If so,
then this conference is for you.

Red Team Summit operates under the Chatham House Rule. Participants are free to
use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of
the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.

Attendance is limited.  Your organization must submit a talk in order to receive
an invitation for attendance. Submission to CFP does not guarantee presentation
acceptance, but does guarantee attendance while capacity remains available.
