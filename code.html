                    <p>Red Team Summit is dedicated to providing an inclusive, harassment-free conference experience for everyone. We encourage all participants to make each other feel welcome in activities throughout the conference.</p>
                    <p>We do not tolerate harassment of any kind. Harassment includes, but is not limited to, deliberate actions such as intimidation or targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.</p>
                    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including expulsion from the event and any future Red Team Summits.</p>
                    <p>If you are being made to feel unwelcome, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer as soon as possible. If you are not sure who to contact, reach out to <b>{{ site.contact_email }}</b>.</p>
