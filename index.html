                        <h3>Red Team Summit 2020 is cancelled</h3>
                        <p>In light of the growing concerns around COVID-19,
                        weâ€™ve decided to cancel the Red Team Summit this year.
                        While this a difficult decision to make, our priority
                        is the health and safety of attendees, employees, and
                        everyone involved in the event. We plan to host the
                        event in-person in 2021.</p>
                        <p>We appreciate your understanding and cooperation. Thank
                        you for your interest in the Red Team Summit and we
                        look forward to joining together next year. If you have
                        any questions, please reach out to our contact
                        email.</p>
